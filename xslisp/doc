executables:

	The executables are created by:
		make [xs|xs0|xs1|xs2|eval.lx|eval1|eval2.lx]

	xs0: gcc -o xs0 -DJOINT -DONLINE front.c
		The evaluator is linked with the frontend,
		i.e., xs0 behaves as an ordinary Lisp system.

	xs1: gcc -o xs1 front.c
		The frontend generates input code to be embedded in
		the evaluator running on Unix.
		The generated code is stored in file "xsout1".

	eval1: gcc -o eval1 eval.c
		The evaluator runs on Unix, by executing the code generated by xs1.
		The code in "xsout1" is #include'd in the source of the evaluation.
		Therefore, remake eval1 each time "xsout1" is created.

	xs2: gcc -o xs2 -DRCX front.c
		The frontend generates input code to be embedded in
		the evaluator running on RCX.
		The generated code is stored in file "xsout2".

	eval2.lx: h8300-gcc -DRCX eval.c
		The evaluator runs on RCX, by executing the code generated by xs2.
		The code in "xsout2" is #include'd in the source of the evaluation.
		Therefore, remake eval2.lx each time "xsout2" is created.

	xs: gcc -o xs -DRCX -DIRCOM -DONLINE front.c
		The frontend communicates with the RCX evaluator through the
		IR port.

	eval.lx: h8300-gcc -DRCX -DIRCOM -DONLINE eval.c
		The evaluator runs on RCX, by communicating with the frontend
		through the IR port.

	The preprocessor macros have the following meanings:
	
		RCX: The evaluator runs on the RCX.
		JOINT: The evaluator is linked with the frontend.
		IRCOM: The frontend commuicates with the evaluator
		       through the IR port.
		ONLINE: The frontend can receive messages from the evaluator.
